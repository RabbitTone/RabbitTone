### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub page, I hope you enjoy your welcome~

I'm a Computer Information Systems undergrad at the **University of Texas at El Paso**. 
Looking to learn more about programming, data science, and Cybersecurity to employ my skills in activism. 

I'm a member of the Association of Information Technology Proffesionals (AITP). 

Besides my career history you'll also find a neat list of albums I've listened to and books I've read for reccomendations.
